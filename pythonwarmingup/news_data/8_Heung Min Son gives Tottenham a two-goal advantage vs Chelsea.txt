Heung-Min Son came into this game with the unenviable task of filling Dele Alli¡¯s shoes. Alli is out for the rest of the season after he was hit with a three-game ban for punching Claudio Yacob. Up until this point, Son has three goals on the year, but his impact has mostly been as a super sub. So when he got the call to start, it was up to him to impress his manager Mauricio Pochettino.

After England and Spurs star Harry Kane put Tottenham up 1-0, Son did just that and scored to give his team a two-goal advantage.Next season will be Tottenham¡¯s first in the Champions League since 2011 and, while Son started a lot of games in the Europa League, Son will be eager to show that he belongs in the Champions League as well. Needless to say, this goal puts him in Pochettino¡¯s good graces.

Tottenham¡¯s rise as a title contender has been one of the bigger surprises this season ? obviously not as big as Leicester ? and their midfield depth has been a big part of it. If Tottenham keep their core players from this year and are able to upgrade through the transfer market, they¡¯ll be a team to watch out for next year.
