Dae-ho Lee will look to make the jump from the Japanese ranks to the big leagues.

Korean first baseman Dae-ho Lee will be looking to move on from the Japanese ranks. According to a report from Jee-ho Yoo of Yonhap News, he has declined his player option for the 2016 season with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks of the Nippon Professional Baseball league in Japan. He has decided to become an international free agent in hopes of landing a major-league contract.
The 33-year-old first baseman had played in the Korean Baseball Organization in Korea for over a decade before making the move to west to Japan. Ever since 2012, Lee had been playing in Japan, playing for both the Orix Buffaloes and the Hawks.
Since he is becoming an unrestricted international free agent, Lee will not warrant a posting fee. That will likely drop the overall asking price and the process will be easier for both sides. ¡°All baseball players dream of playing in the majors, and I¡¯d like to pursue that dream,¡± Lee explained in his press conference. ¡°If I can give 100 percent, like I¡¯ve done throughout my career, I don¡¯t think it will be impossible.¡±
In 141 games played this season for the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, Lee posted a .282/.368/.524 slash line over 584 plate appearances, along with 31 home runs and 98 runs batted in. Over his fifteen-year career in both Korea and Japan, he is the proud owner of a .303/.387/.514 slash line over 7103 plate appearances, along with 323 home runs and 1157 runs batted in, in 1720 games played.
