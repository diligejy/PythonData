Korean first baseman Dae-ho Lee is getting some interest from a Major League Baseball team. He had been training with his former team the Lotte Giants in Arizona, but canceled plans according to Jee-ho Yoo of Korea's Yonhap News Agency. He indicated the trip has been postponed to meet an interested MLB team. Lee's former club the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks of the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) are set to start Spring Training in a couple of weeks, and wish to retain the slugger.

Lee 6-4 290, listed as a first baseman, but would be more of a designated hitter in MLB. Last season, Lee smashed 31 home runs, knocking in 98 runs with a slash line of .282/.368/.524. Lee is just seeking a one-year deal according to the report, and could be of interest to the Houston Astros. Star prospect A.J. Reed will likely get some seasoning against advanced pitchers at AAA. A one-year deal for them would be an ideal set up. The Astros only have weak hitting Jonathan Singleton at first base to start the 2016 season. He could fit with any needing a right hand hitter to platoon at first base or designated hitter.
