Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Ryu Hyun-jin left a training camp in Glendale, Arizona on Tuesday and rejoined the team. 

"I returned to Los Angeles for the first time in three months," he said. 

Ryu had surgery on his left shoulder last season and started the new season on the disabled list, staying in the training camp to focus on rehabilitation. 

If everything goes well as planned, he will be able to make a return to the big league in mid-May or June.
