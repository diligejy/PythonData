Lee Dae-ho left for Arizona on Tuesday where the Seattle Mariners have spring training.

"Lee planned to leave for the U.S. after obtaining a work visa which takes about a month but changed his plans at the request of the team to join with teammates as early as possible," said his agency Montis Sports Management Group.

Lee is expected to start training this weekend.
