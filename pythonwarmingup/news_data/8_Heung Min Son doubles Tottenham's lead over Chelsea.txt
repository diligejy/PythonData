Tottenham Hotspur now have a 2-0 lead over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge as halftime approaches. Christian Eriksen again played a huge role in the build-up of the goal. This time he threaded a pass through to Heung-Min Son, who calmly beat Begovic to the near-post. This is going a lot more swimmingly than anyone thought it would have.
