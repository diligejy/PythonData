Through 25 games in 2016, Twins' offseason signee Byung-ho Park has hit .253 with seven home runs and 12 RBI, getting on-base at a .326 rate. His .921 OPS is second-best on the Twins.

Fantasy Impact: This is about what we expected from Park, a slight decrease in his overall numbers in the KBO, but still a solid contributor in the MLB with plenty of pop. He has struck out 27 times in 79 at-bats, which is something he will have to improve upon to succeed in the MLB.
