Last year¡¯s Japan Series MVP Lee Dae-ho improved his chance of making the Seattle Mariners¡¯ roster with his first two-hit game of the spring Tuesday. One of them was also his first double.

The 33-year-old Korean slugger broke out of a mini 1 for 10 slump by going 2 for 3 against the Los Angeles Angels in Cactus League action in Arizona. With only 18 at-bats under his belt going into the game, it didn¡¯t take much to make his numbers look good right away. After two hits in his first two at-bats, his batting average had reached .300 for the spring.

Lee¡¯s first hit came in the very first inning, as he stepped into the batter¡¯s box as the fifth hitter (DH) with two on board against lefty Andrew Heaney and delivered a clutch two-out line drive single to left to give the Mariners a 1-0 lead.

He stepped into the batter¡¯s box with two outs again in the third inning, but had to wait until the fourth to get his second hit of the day, as the first base runner got picked off to end the inning.

The Angels changed the pitcher to right-hander Joe Smith, and Lee greeted him with his first double to leadoff the fourth. He would later come around to score on Daniel Robertson¡¯s two-out double.

Lee grounded out to pitcher Al Alburquerque in the sixth before being replaced by another designated hitter candidate Jesus Montero.

Lee is now 6 for 21 (.286) with one double, one home run, five runs and four RBIs.

Angels¡¯ Korean first baseman Choi Ji-man went 1 for 4. His batting average stands at .258.
