Ryu Hyun-jin (29), the Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher who is taking rehabilitation training after undergoing shoulder surgery, appeared before his home fans on Tuesday. Ryu joined his team at the team¡¯s opening game at its home turf of the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. He returned to the team three months after having rehabilitation training in Glendale, Arizona from January.
¡°I am very happy to be back in Los Angeles. My rehabilitation training is proceeding smoothly. My shoulder is in good condition, and preparation is proceeding well,¡± he said on his second live pitching (pitching training by placing a batter) conducted on Tuesday, displaying self-confidence. ¡°I am expected to do another live pitching training session, before taking the mound at an exercise game.¡± The number of pitches he throws at live pitching sessions is also gradually increasing.
His team did not release Ryu¡¯s detailed schedule going forward. However, considering that Ryu mentioned an exercise game, watchers predict that he could return to games before early June, a timeline U.S. media had forecast. Ryu, who was seen having his mustache grown wild because he could not have his hair cut during rehabilitation training, headed to a barbershop after the media interview.
