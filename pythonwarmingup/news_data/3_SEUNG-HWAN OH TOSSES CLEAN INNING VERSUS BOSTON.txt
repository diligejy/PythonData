Cardinals set-up man Seung-Hwan Oh tossed a scoreless, hitless inning with one strikeout versus the Boston Red Sox on Monday.

Fantasy Impact: Oh has been excellent this spring, much better than the bullpen cast around him this season. In a league which counts holds and saves, he may be one of the most valuable RP without a role closing this Spring.
