GLENDALE, Ariz. ? Despite what could be as much as a week between bullpen sessions, recovering Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu insisted Wednesday that he is not experiencing any kind of setback.

Ryu, who still is on the mend after shoulder surgery in May, last threw a bullpen session at Dodgers camp on Friday, his second bullpen of the spring. And he said he might not throw another one for another two days, minimum.

¡°I¡¯m just following all the steps, all the pace-by-pace and whatever they have planned,¡± Ryu said through an interpreter. ¡°After the second bullpen session, this was the plan to rest, so I am just going along with that and I feel great.¡±

Ryu¡¯s spring schedule already was at a more controlled pace than the rest of his healthy teammates. He isn¡¯t expected back into the major league rotation until May, giving him a full year to recovery from his surgery.

¡°There is definitely no pain,¡± he said. ¡°Obviously after the bullpens, you have typical muscle soreness.¡±

The 26-year old is no rookie when it comes to rehabbing from surgery. He underwent a Tommy John procedure in 2004, while he was still in high school.

As for his current extended break between throwing sessions, Ryu characterized it as something that was expected.

¡°I¡¯m very happy and satisfied with the timetable they have given me,¡± he said. ¡°They have given me time to rest and they have planned all this out. Whatever they had given I¡¯m just pleased with that.

¡°Even given the Tommy John surgery that I had before, there will be good times and bad times. You just have to ride it out.¡±
