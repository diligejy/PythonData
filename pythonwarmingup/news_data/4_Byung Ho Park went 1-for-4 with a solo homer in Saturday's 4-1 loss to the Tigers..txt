The Korean-born slugger was the sole source of offense for the beleaguered Minnesota Twins squad Saturday, blasting his second homer in the last three games. Park leads the team in the long ball category, but is struggling at the plate overall right along with the rest of his teammates. He's slashing .227/.288/.561 over 66 at-bats in his first season stateside.
