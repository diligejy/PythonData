Cardinals set-up man Seung-Hwan Oh shut the Twins down in one inning on Monday, allowing no hits and striking out one - fellow countryman Byung-Ho Park.

Fantasy Impact: It was a nice start for Oh who should be a lock for the Cardinals setup role to closer Trevor Rosenthal. Rosenthal is a solid closer but is not elite, and Oh would likely be the first to take over for him should he struggle in 2016.
