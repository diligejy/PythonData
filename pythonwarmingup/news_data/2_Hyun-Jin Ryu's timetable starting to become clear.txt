GLENDALE, Ariz. -- While the Los Angeles Dodgers are wrapping up spring training this week, Hyun-Jin Ryu is just starting his.

Manager Dave Roberts said Ryu will throw a final bullpen session Wednesday and then start facing hitters in live batting practice by the weekend.
The left-hander, who had shoulder surgery last year, has been in camp ever since the Dodgers reported in February, but progressed slowly over the past month, even taking an extended break to combat soreness.

Asked if Ryu is essentially on a spring training timetable now, when pitchers would transition to live BP once position players arrived in camp, Roberts said, ¡°That¡¯s fair.¡±

A normal spring lasts six weeks, meaning that Ryu is about five weeks away from completing a typical preseason progression of bullpens, live BP and games every five days, while building a pitch count in each start.

It suggests that Ryu would be ready to pitch in games, without restrictions, by the second week of May.

Left unsaid is whether or not Ryu will pitch in minor league games after his spring training progression is complete, or if he would join the Dodgers then. He had originally been expected to return to the team in May, but his extended break at the start of March hinted at a June return.

Ryu is one of two Dodgers starting pitchers expected to return to the club before the All-Star break. Brandon McCarthy, who had Tommy John surgery last April, has an ambitious goal of making at least two starts for the Dodgers before the traditional mid-season break.
