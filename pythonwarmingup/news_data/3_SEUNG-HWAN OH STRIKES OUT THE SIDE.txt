Cardinals set-up man Seung-Hwan Oh had an excellent outing on Tuesday, striking out the side in the sixth inning.

Fantasy Impact: Oh is yet to allow a run out of the Cardinals bullpen this season, and has struck out five of the eight batters he has faced. As the game was tied when he pitched, he received no hold.
