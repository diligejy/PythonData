Hyun-Jin Ryu remains shut down as he works his way back from shoulder surgery.

On Friday, Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said he expected Ryu to throw a bullpen session this weekend. But Saturday morning, Roberts indicated Ryu was still being held back. Roberts insisted ¡°it¡¯s definitely not a setback,¡± but part of the team¡¯s long-term strategy.

¡°There is no date [for Ryu to throw his next bullpen session],¡± Roberts said. ¡°But the staff had a built-in, back-off period, where they can back off and then pick it up again. But there¡¯s no date when he¡¯s going to start throwing again.¡±

When camp opened, the Dodgers said they expected Ryu to pitch in a Cactus League game. Ryu himself revealed his goals were to join the team in May, make 20 starts and log 150 innings. Those milestones become less and less likely as he remains idle.

Ryu experienced soreness in his left arm after throwing a bullpen session on Feb. 26. He has not thrown since. At some point in the future, Roberts explained, Ryu will resume his throwing program.
