Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Ryu Hyun-jin (29), who is taking rehabilitation training after surgery, might have a setback in his schedule of returning to the mound. "I think the whole time we thought we were going to have him back sooner, but there was a setback early in spring, middle of spring,¡± Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.
It is the first time that Ryu has complained of pain in his body other than the shoulder that he underwent surgery in May last year. Watchers say it is rather fortunate that his pain is not in his shoulder. Ryu wished to make the roster for the season¡¯s opening game, but is undergoing a longer rehabilitation process due to his shoulder pain in February.
¡°We need him back, but we need him back healthy,¡± Roberts said. "He's still doing things to keep his arm in shape, but we're going to take a couple of days to let this calm down before we get him back on the mound."
