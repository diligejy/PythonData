It was announced today by Daniel Kim of KBS Sports that the Minnesota Twins had placed the winning bid of $12.85 million to negotiate with power-hitting Korean first baseman Byung-Ho Park, who hit .343 with 53 home runs and 146 RBI playing for the Nexen Heroes last season. However, though the 29-year-old has talent, he won¡¯t solve the Twins¡¯ greater problems and, assuming that a deal can be struck between both parties in the next 30 days, will be a mere band-aid solution.

From a money standpoint, submitting a bid for Park isn¡¯t a bad decision on Minnesota¡¯s part by any stretch of the imagination. Without factoring contracts that have yet to be determined via arbitration, the team¡¯s payroll for next season is currently at $73 million, per Spotrac. It was at $106 million in 2015, well below the luxury tax threshold, and there is little to suggest that there will be a significant rise in it come 2016. In the case of Park, if no deal is struck, Minnesota gets it¡¯s $12.85 million refunded and Park heads back to Nexen for next season. No harm, no foul. Long story short, the team can afford him.

But though Park could indeed be of a great help to a Twins¡¯ team that went 83-79 in 2015, each win costing just under $1.3 million, he wouldn¡¯t solve Minnesota¡¯s problems overnight. The Twins tied for 12th in MLB with 696 runs scored, but ranked 26th with a team batting average of just .247 and 28th in on-base percentage (OBP) at just .305. Minnesota also ranked 18th with a team slugging percentage of .399 and 16th with 156 home runs.

Much of those numbers above can be attributed to Target Field, the Twins¡¯ $545 million ($589 million in 2015) stadium that opened in 2010, putting an end to nearly three decades of Twins baseball at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. Consider this. In 2009, the Twins¡¯ final year at the Metrodome, the team ranked third in batting average, 13th in home runs, fifth in OBP and ninth in slugging percentage en route to the AL Central Division crown. The following year, though the team made the playoffs again, Minnesota dipped to 19th in home runs, but stayed third in batting average and improved to second in OBP and seventh in slugging. Though improved, the dip in power was indicative that Target Field was not at all a hitter¡¯s park the same way the Metrodome was, with only five players hitting double figures in home runs compared to six in 2009.

Which brings the conversation to the next point: despite Park¡¯s talent, first base is currently occupied in Minnesota by three-time batting champion and former AL MVP Joe Mauer. Going back to 2009, local hero Mauer was the player fans came to see in Minnesota. That year, despite missing nearly a month of action to start the season, he led MLB with a .365 batting average while also slugging 28 home runs with 96 RBI as he manned the catcher¡¯s spot. Teammate Justin Morneau handled first base and hit .274 with 30 home runs and 100 RBI, and it was expected that the two would continue to put up top production in the new stadium.
