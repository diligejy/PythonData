The Twins have had their eye on the South Korean slugger since high school, and judging by his recent 462-foot blast to center field, their instincts were right. After a slow start, Park seems to be adapting to American baseball, and its faster pitching.

Longtime friend J.D. Kim is Park¡¯s translator.

¡°I¡¯m not going to lie, it¡¯s not easy making those transitions seamless,¡± Park said, according to translator Kim. ¡°And I didn¡¯t expect it to be easy. Like you said, it¡¯s a big transition. It¡¯s a great feeling and really relieving to know that your coaching staff and your teammates are supporting you, regardless of how well or poorly you¡¯re doing.¡±


Off the field, Park¡¯s been busy getting his wife and toddler son settled in the Twin Cities, checking out the sites and figuring out how to get around town.

He¡¯s getting to know his teammates too, clubhouse antics and all.

¡°I can definitely sense that everybody in this clubhouse is trying not to make me feel alone here,¡± Park said via Kim. ¡°They¡¯re trying to make jokes around me, trying to make conversation. And when we¡¯re on the road, they ask me if I want to go out to dinner, get something to eat, so I really appreciate that.¡±

One night at spring training, some of the guys even had him over to watch an episode of the Bachelor ? something Park rolls his eyes at and says he¡¯ll never understand.
